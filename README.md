Digital Green Certificates (DGC)
================================

This repo aims as a starting point for DGC (aka vaccination certificates)
forensics. It collects standards, documents and other resources
which are necessary to understand DGCs and the crypto behind it.

If you [wonder about the name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUTGr5t3MoY) of this repo.

The documents are under the Creative Commons CC 3.0 (WHO) and 4.0 (EU)
license, as stated within the particular PDF files. None of the documents
were modified and are just a pure copy in order to have them in a single place. There are some EU documents which explicitly have a more strict
licensing and are theoretically only distributable by EU or
their member states. Though, they may be downloaded
[here (EU DPIA-Draft)](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/default/files/ehealth/docs/efgs_dpia_en.pdf) and are therefore not part of this repo.
