Digital Green Certificates (DGC)
================================

This repo aims as a starting point for DGC (aka vaccination certificates)
forensics. It collects standards, documents and other ressources
which are necessary to understand DGCs and the crypto behind it.

If you [wonder about the name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUTGr5t3MoY) of this repo.

The documents are under the Creative Commons CC 3.0 (WHO) and 4.0 (EU)
license. There are some EU documents which explicitely have a more strict
licensing and are theoretically only distributable by EU or
their member states. Though, they are publically downloadable
[here, EU DPIA-Draft](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/default/files/ehealth/docs/efgs_dpia_en.pdf) and are therefore not part of this repo.
